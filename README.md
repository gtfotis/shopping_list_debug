# DOM SHOPPING LIST

## My cart is busted!

My shopping list exercise from yesterday is broken. I load the page, type in the fields, click the button and ...

There are at least 5 errors in this project. They range from typos, incorrect methods, or flat out missing methods.

**NOTE:** _All_ the errors are in the `scripts.js` file. The HTML and CSS files are fine.

Load the page, and start debugging!

## Hints

* Are the scripts even loading?
* Does the button do anything when you click it?
* Are things spelled correctly?
* Are the right items, or number of items, being selected?
* Are the new elements being created?
* Are created elements being appended to something in the DOM?

## Debugging Tips

* Load the Dev Tools _immediately_.
* Make generous use of `console.log()` statements to see what is and isn't running.
* Work on _one_ error at a time, then move on to another.
* Fixing one error will then uncover any more errors, don't get frustrated, keep moving on until _all_ the errors are gone.
